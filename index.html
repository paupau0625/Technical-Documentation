      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Motorcycles are one of the most efficient vehicles for travel, offering speed, flexibility, and low fuel consumption.</p>
      <p>Understanding how motorcycles work makes maintenance easier and helps riders troubleshoot common issues.</p>
      <p>Basic motorcycle knowledge can help prevent breakdowns and reduce repair costs.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What are motorcycles used for?</li>
        <li>Why understanding motorcycle basics is important?</li>

    <section class="main-section" id="Basics">
      <h2>Basics</h2> 
      <p>The essential parts of a motorcycle include the engine, transmission, brakes, tires, and electrical system.</p> 
      <p>These components work together to make the motorcycle accelerate, stop, and remain stable.</p> 
      <code>Engine = The heart of the motorcycle</code> 
      <p>The engine burns fuel to create power that rotates the wheels.</p> 
      <ul> 
        <li>Engine</li> 
        <li>Transmission</li> 
        <li>Tires</li> 
        <li>Brakes</li> 
      </ul> 
      <code>Brake_Pressure = Hydraulic Fluid + Lever Force</code>
    </section>


    <section class="main-section" id="Motorcycle_Types">
      <h2>Motorcycle Types</h2>
      <p>There are many categories of motorcycles built for different riding styles and environments.</p>
      <p>Each type varies in comfort, speed, power, and performance.</p>
      <code>Sportbike = High-speed performance motorcycle</code>
      <p>Some motorcycles are designed for daily commuting, while others are built for long-distance touring or off-road riding.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Standard</li>
        <li>Sportbike</li>
        <li>Cruiser</li>
        <li>Dirt Bike</li>
        <li>Electric Motorcycle</li>
      </ul>
      <code>EV_Charge_Time = Battery_Size / Charger_Power</code>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
      <h2>Functions</h2>
      <p>Motorcycles perform several key functions that allow them to operate safely and efficiently.</p>
      <p>These include ignition, fuel combustion, steering, braking, and suspension movement.</p>
      <code>
      Ignition() {
      return "Engine Starting...";
      }
      </code>
      <p>The ignition system starts the engine by delivering electrical energy to the spark plugs.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Starting the engine</li>
        <li>Handlebar steering</li>
        <li>Front and rear braking</li>
        <li>Power delivery to the wheels</li>
      </ul>
      <code>Brake_Distance = Speed * Reaction_Time</code>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Advanced_Motorcycles">
      <header>Advanced Motorcycles</header>
      <p>Modern motorcycles are equipped with advanced features such as ABS, traction control, ride modes, and electric motors.</p>
      <p>These technologies enhance safety, performance, and riding comfort.</p>
      <code>Ride_Mode(speed) {
      if (speed <= 60) return "Eco Mode";
      return "Sport Mode Recommended";
      }
      </code>
      <p>Advanced motorcycles include hybrid systems, electric bikes, and models with semi-autonomous rider assist features.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ABS braking</li>
        <li>Traction control</li>
        <li>Electric motors</li>
        <li>Advanced safety sensors</li>
      </ul>
      <code>Battery_Range = Capacity_kWh * Efficiency</code>
